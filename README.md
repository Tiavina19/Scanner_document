# Project Specifications - Document Scanner

## Introduction
The project aims to develop and test a functional prototype of the text recognition feature. This prototype will serve as a basis for evaluating the technical feasibility of text recognition in our document scanner application.

## Objective
The main goal is to create a document scanner application with the following features:

1. User authentication via a login page.
2. Redirection to the home page after authentication.
3. Features on the home page:
   - Scan a document and convert it to PDF.
   - Scan an identity card and convert it to PDF.
   - Import a file and convert it to PDF.
   - Import a photo and convert it to PDF.
4. Implementation of a Front-End and Back-End system to manage the mentioned features.
